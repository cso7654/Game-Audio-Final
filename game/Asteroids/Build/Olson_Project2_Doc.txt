All assets created by Cameron Olson.

Controls:

Use W to accelerate and S to decelerate.
A turns counterclockwise and D turns clockwise.
Q and E slowly turn counterclockwise and clockwise, respectively, almost as if to "nudge" the ship for better aim.
Space fires a bullet and advances menus.

Gameplay:

Asteroid speed and spawn rate start slow and increase slightly with every small asteroid you destroy.
Getting hit will cost you a life, and give you 3 seconds of invulnerability to recover (shown by your ship flashing red).
Breaking a large asteroid into smaller ones gets you 10 points, and destroying the smaller asteroids gets you 20.

Extra Features (Above and Beyond):

Aesthetic particle systems for thrusters, explosions, and projectiles.
Menu and game over screens.
Invulnerability/Recovery period upon being hit.
Gradually increasing difficulty as gameplay goes on.
UI that scales to screen and doesn't make me rip my hair out because my laptop is 4k and Unity makes everything tiny but only in the builds (more a feature for me than anything else).

Original project uploaded on the 16th. Current build uploaded on the 22nd for additional features and better documentation.
